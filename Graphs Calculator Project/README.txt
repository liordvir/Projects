This project was made for the Technion's MATAM course (Object Oriented Programming course).
As its name suggests, it is a calculator for graphs 
(with edges and vertices such that you would find in Combinatorics courses)

-Project was coded in C++ (mainly) and Python
-Project contains a Graph class with simple logical operations.
-A sudo-bash shell was created as interface for using the calculator.
-In order for the shell to work a PARSER was created.
-An exception class was written for informational remarks using the shell.

-Function were created and incorporated for saving and loading graphs to binary files.
-A Python interface was created and connected with SWIG alowing use of program with Python.

-Project can be run actively through the shell or fed with prewritten command input files 
 with the option to paste output into output files.

A design PDF file describing project dependencies was added to folder.

To run project either run files in folder or run attached makefile through bash.

Please view the input and output files in the "Test Example" folder for an example of how the program works.

Thank you!
