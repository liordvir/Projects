Hello!
In here you will find the DeathChase Project made for Elecricity lab course as a joint project with the excellent Noam Elata.

Unfortunately The easiest way to view and play the project is extracting and running the archived file using Intel Quartus on an Intel FPGA board.
Incase of lack of Quartus and FPGA board I added some code examples in "Code Snippets" direcrory.

For a very silly youtube video showing the project click here: https://youtu.be/Zo0ZTtgOE0k


In this project we used System Verilog programming language to code the game and run it on an FPGA board in the Quartus invironment.
-Debugged using Waveforms and Signal Tap
(It's actually a pretty fun game!)
